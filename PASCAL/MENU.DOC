This TPU was mainly written so a database I wrote could have a more user-
friendly interface, but another reason was because a friend of mine,
(a.k.a. QuasarMan), wrote up a LOT of menus, and he changed them frequently!!
'WriteLn' this, 'WriteLn' that.  'GotoXY(X,Y)', 'Write('<A>  Add name')',
'GotoXY(X,Y)', 'Write('<D>  Delete name')', and so on. . .
    Gets pretty tedious doesn't it??  Below is the list of commands and what
they do:



            C(color, intensity)
                     Yes, the "C" does stand for "COLOR".  A one-letter
                     command is much easier then 'TextColor(color)'.
                     "color" represents the text color you choose, and
                     "intensity" represents the video intensity.
                     (i.e.  0 = Normal Video, 1 = Low Video, 2 = High Video)
                     Here is an example of usage:

                          c(14,2);


            BACKDROP
                     This command creates a background for menus, like the
                     one used in the Novell NetWare menus.

            MENUCREATOR(X, Y, selection, text, menu variable)
                     I couldn't come up with another name for this
                     procedure, so it stuck.  "X" is the X-coordinate
                     the menu option will start on, "Y" is the Y-coordinate
                     the menu option will start on.  "selection"
                     represents the menu selection used to call upon this
                     menu option (i.e.  'A' will display "<A>").
                     "text" represents then menu selection text
                     (i.e.  'Add name' will display "Add name").
                     Sorry, but the text can be only 29 charactors long.
                     "Menu variable" is my menu control variable. If
                     you place 'O' as this parameter, this means
                     your menu only will have one option. A 'B' means
                     that this option will be your first option in the
                     menu, an 'E' means that this option will be your
                     last option in this menu, and a 'C' means that this
                     option will be an option that is in between the first
                     and last one.  Here is an example of usage:

                          MenuCreator(20,11,'A','Add name','B');
                          MenuCreator(20,12,'D','Delete name','C');
                          MenuCreator(20,13,'Q','Quit','E');


            BOX(X, Y, length, text, Box variable)
                     This procedure prints a box around a string of text.
                     The "X" represents the X-cooridnate which the box will
                     start. A zero as this parameter will place the text in
                     the center of the screen.  The "Y" represents the
                     Y-cooridnate which the box will start.  "Length"
                     represents the length of the text you type in.
                     "Box variable" is the box control variable. If you
                     place 'O' as this parameter you only want one line of
                     text.  A 'B' means that this is your first line of
                     text, an 'E' means that this is your last line of text,
                     and a 'C' means that this line of text is not the
                     first one and not the last one.
                     Here is an example of usage:

                          Box(18,10,32,'Now is the time','B');
                          Box(18,11,32,'     for every good man','C');
                          Box(18,12,32,'              to come to the aid','C');
                          Box(18,13,32,'     of his country','E');
