      The amazing, fabulous, incredible, outstanding Magic card database.
                             (Yeah, RIGHT)

        The history of this program is quite an interesting story, but 
let's skip that.  Oh all right, I'll tell you the story.  For those of you 
who don't want to read it or just plain don't care, skip this paragraph and
go on to the rest of the document.  Otherwise, ENJOY!!!    This program began
as only one character.  Then it became two characters.  And so on.  This 
program began as an AP Computer Science assignment, and developed into a
Magic card database after that.  Scroll Keeper was writen in Turbo Pascal 
V 6.0.  But enough of the legal stuff.  This document is being released with 
SK version 1.00, programed by Chris Sohns and Dan Sullivan.
